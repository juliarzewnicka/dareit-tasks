List enabled services in GCP using either Cloud Shell or Cloud SDK installed on a local machine. 

**How to:**
Check the  [GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference)  ðŸ”— to get a command to list enabled services in your project.

**Result:**
The file **enabled_services.txt** contains the return of the command `gcloud sevices list --enabled` . The command `gcloud services list` also lists the same services, because the flag `--enabled` is the default.
